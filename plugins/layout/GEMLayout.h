/// An implementation of a spring-embedder layout.
/** This plugin is an implementation of the GEM-2d layout
 *  algorithm first published as:
 *
 *  A. Frick, A. Ludwig, and H. Mehldau, \n
 *  "A fast, adaptive layout algorithm for undirected graphs", \n
 *  In R. Tamassia and I. Tollis (Eds), \n
 *  Graph Drawing'94, \n
 *  Volume 894 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer Verlag, 1995.
 *
 *  <b>HISTORY</b>
 *
 *  The implementation started life as the public-domain
 *  code produced by Arne Frick and released at
 *
 *  www.frick-consulting.de/publications.html
 *
 *  The core "embedder" part of the algorithm was used in the
 *  implementation of a Java plugin for the CWI "Royere" tool,
 *  and then this code was ported to C++ to make the
 *  implementation given here.
 *
 *
 *  \note The embedder algorithm described by Frick involves three
 *  phases: insertion, arrangement, and optimization.  Only
 *  the first two of these phases are included here.
 *  Experiments with the Java implementation showed that the
 *  optimization phase consumed significantly more time than
 *  the first two and produced apparently marginal improvements
 *  in the final layout.\n
 *  As GEM, like other spring-embedder algorithms, is
 *  computationally expensive, I have tried to optimize the
 *  loops somewhat by storing all necessary node information
 *  into two arrays: "GemProp" carries the (scalar) values
 *  associated with each node by the layout algorithm, while
 *  "Adjacent" is an array of vectors, one vector per node,
 *  giving the index (integer) of each node.
 *
 * \note The new version has been reimplemented to manage edge length
 * it merges the 3D stuff and removes the use of integers (new CPU do not
 * require it anymore).
