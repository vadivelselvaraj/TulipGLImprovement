tlp.averagePathLength(graph)

Returns the average path length of a graph, that is the sum
of the shortest distances for all pair of distinct nodes in that graph
divided by the number of those pairs. For a pair of non connected nodes,
the shorted distance is set to 0.

Returns the clustering coefficient of a graph
as the average of the local clustering coefficients
(see :func:`tlp.clusteringCoefficient`) of all the nodes.

%Docstring 
tlp.clusteringCoefficient(graph, result[, maxDepth = 1])

Assigns to each node its local clustering coefficient
that is the proportion of edges between the nodes within its neighbourhood
divided by the number of edges that could possibly exist between them.
This quantifies how close its neighbors are to being a clique.

tlp.dagLevel(graph, result)

Assigns to each node of a Directed Acyclic Graph a level such that
if the edge e(u,v) exists level(u) < level(v). 
The algorithm ensures that the number of level used is minimal.
