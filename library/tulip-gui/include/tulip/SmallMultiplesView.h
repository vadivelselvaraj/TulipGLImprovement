///**
//  * @brief This class provides an abstraction for the View class to help user creates small multiples views.
//  * A Small multiples view is used to display various visualisation of a same data set in the same window.
//  * Basically, the Small multiples view displays an overviews of items the user can select to set focus on them.
//  *
//  * @example We want to display frequency histograms for metrics in a graph. This graph can contains several metrics and we want to display one histogram per each.
//  *          Each item will correspond to a metric. In the overview mode, we will display raw overviews for our histograms.
//  *          When the user sets focus on one item, we will display a more accurate representation of this peculiar histogram and allow specific interactions on it.
//  *
//  * In depth, the SmallMultiplesView contains a GlMainWidget, displaying a graph (different from the one set on the view). Each node of this graph is associated to an item.
//  * When sublassing SmallMultiplesView, the user can define several properties on each of those items. Values for those properties are retrieved from the virtual data method.
//  * This method is meant to return a QVariant containing a value whose type differs according the role the SmallMultiplesView wants to display:
//  *
//  * Role     |   Type in the QVariant | Description
//  *          |                        |
//  * Label    |         QString        | The name that will be displayed beyond the item preview in overview mode.
//  * Texture  |         QString        | The texutre used to preview the item in overview mode.
//  * Position |       tlp::Coord       | The position of the item's preview in overview mode.
//  *
//  * By default, a SmallMultiplesView always comes along the Small multiples navigation interactor. This interactor provides a way to navigate in overview and to select items by double-clicking them.
//  * When not in overview mode. This interactor only alow the user to double click to switch back to overview.
//  * To add this interactor to your SmallMultiplesView implementation, use the following macro:
//  * @code INTERACTORPLUGINVIEWEXTENSIONWITHPRIORITY(<class name for the interactor>, "Interactor name", "InteractorSmallMultiplesNavigation", "<Name of the view>", "<Author>", "<Date>", "<description>", "<version>", INT_MAX)
//  * @warning Note that the priority defined with this macro should always be set to the highest value possible (INT_MAX) to ensure that this interactor will always be installed before all others.
//  *
//  * We will now detail more about the behavior in overview and specific modes.
//  *
//  * . Overview mode: Displays a graph where each node is asociated to an item. The graph is displayed in a GlMainWidget in a layer called "overview"
//  *                  @warning The overview layer mus never be deleted
//  *                  In this mode, only the small multiples navigation interactor is enabled (@see toggleInteractors(bool)). The role methos is called to get information about items.
//  *                  The user may emit the dataChanged signal to inform the view that data needs to be refreshed on one or several items.
//  *                  When the user double clicks on an item, the itemSelected method is called.
//  *
//  * . Specific mode: When the isOverview method returns false, the SmallMultiplesView is considered to be in the specific mode.
//  *                  The user can redefine this method to change the default behavior (we consider to be in the specific mode when the overview layer is not visible)
//  *                  When in the specifc mode, you may want to call the toggleInteractors(bool) method to enable your specific interactors.
//  *                  When the small multiples navigation interactor is enabled in this mode, the overviewSelected method is called when the user double clicks.
