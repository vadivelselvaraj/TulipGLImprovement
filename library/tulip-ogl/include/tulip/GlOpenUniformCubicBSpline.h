/**
 * \brief A class to draw open uniform cubic B-splines
 *
 *  A B-spline is a convenient form for representing complicated, smooth curves. A cubic uniform B-spline is a
 *  piecewise collection of cubic BÃ©zier curves, connected end to end. A cubic B-spline is C^2 continuous, meaning there is no discontinuities in curvature.
 *  B-splines have local control : parameters of a B-spline only affect a small part of the entire spline.
 *  A B-spline is qualified as open when it passes through its first and last control points.
