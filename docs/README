Tulip documentation version 0.1 Readme file.

This part is under LGPL licence,(see COPYING.LESSER file in Tulip directory).

To compile the documentation :

	make html
	make pdf (optional, just for a pdf version of the Handbooks)
	make install

==============================================================================================
!!! Note that it is possible to compile without the Internet. 
If you have a problem and the compilation failed, it is probably because some files try it. 
To resolve it, you can comment the line 
	<!DOCTYPE catalog PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD XML Catalogs V1.0//EN"
            "http://www.oasis-open.org/commitees/entity/release/1.0/catalog.dtd">

So for Fedora Core 4, change the files /etc/xml/catalog and /usr/share/sgml/docbook/xmlcatalog
==============================================================================================
