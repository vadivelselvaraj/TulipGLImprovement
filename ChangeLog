	associated to a graphs elements, support for textures and extrusion 
	in the 3D renderer that enables images to be displayed on nodes and 
	edges using swept surfaces, the enhancement of the Import/export format 
	for saving camera positions, and the enhancement of several graph drawing algorithms. 

Release 1.2.1 Tulip
	A new rendering method ("Fan rendering") has been added in order to 
	navigate in trees. Support of meta nodes (nodes containing a graph) 
	has been added in the the library and in the OpenGl renderer, and a 
	progress bar mechanism has been added in order to interrupt the algorithm. 
	There were other bugfixes and enhancements. 

Release 1.2.0 Tulip
